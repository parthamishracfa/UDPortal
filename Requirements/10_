### Specifications for the Single-Pane-of-Glass (SPOG) Portal Development

This document outlines detailed specifications tailored for the Business Analysis, Design, Development, and Deployment teams. These specs build directly on the functional and non-functional requirements previously defined, focusing on creating a unified portal for integrating data catalogs (e.g., Unity Catalog, Horizon Catalog, Polaris Catalog), data sources, data products, and BI tools (e.g., PowerBI, Tableau, Looker, QuickSight). The goal is to enable seamless discovery, creation, and consumption of data assets while ensuring governance, scalability, and user adoption.

Specifications are structured by team for clarity, with cross-references to promote collaboration. All teams should align on key principles: modularity for extensibility, security-by-design, and iterative development using agile methodologies (e.g., 2-week sprints with demos). Success metrics include 80% user adoption within 6 months post-launch, measured via engagement analytics.

#### Business Analysis Team Specifications
The Business Analysis (BA) team will translate high-level requirements into actionable artifacts, focusing on business value, user needs, and alignment with organizational goals. Emphasize stakeholder interviews, prioritization, and traceability to requirements.

- **User Personas and Journeys**:
  - Define personas: Data Steward (focus on governance), Data Analyst (focus on derivation and reporting), Business User (focus on consumption and subscriptions), Administrator (focus on integrations and security).
  - Map end-to-end journeys: E.g., "As a Data Analyst, I discover a dataset in Unity Catalog, create a derived dataset from multiple sources, define a data product with SLAs, build a Tableau dashboard, and subscribe colleagues for updates."
  - Include edge cases: Multi-cloud access conflicts, high-volume data derivation failures, or regulatory data masking.

- **Use Cases and User Stories**:
  - Prioritize 20-30 core use cases, categorized by portal aspects (e.g., catalog integration, data product creation).
  - Example User Story: "As a Business User, I want to search across Polaris Catalog and Snowflake sources using natural language, so I can quickly find relevant datasets with quality scores >90%."
  - Acceptance Criteria: Include success/failure scenarios, performance thresholds (e.g., search <2 seconds), and governance checks (e.g., auto-classify sensitive data).
  - Traceability Matrix: Link each story to requirements, with MoSCoW prioritization (Must-have: Core integrations; Should-have: AI recommendations; Could-have: Custom themes; Won't-have: On-prem only support).

- **Business Rules and KPIs**:
  - Define rules: E.g., Data products must include lineage, ownership, and quality KPIs; subscriptions require approval workflows.
  - KPIs: Data discovery time reduction by 50%, error rates <1% in derivations, compliance audit pass rate 100%.
  - Risk Analysis: Identify risks like integration silos or low adoption; mitigate with training plans and pilot phases.

- **Deliverables and Timeline**:
  - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Persona workshops, use case documentation.
  - Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): User stories in tools like Jira, with backlog grooming.
  - Collaborate with Design for wireframe validation and Development for feasibility checks.

#### Design Team Specifications
The Design team will focus on user-centric interfaces, ensuring intuitive navigation, accessibility, and visual consistency. Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD for prototypes, adhering to WCAG 2.1 standards for accessibility.

- **UI/UX Principles**:
  - Adopt a clean, modular design with a dark/light mode toggle, responsive for desktop/mobile.
  - Navigation: Sidebar for sections (Catalogs, Data Sources, Products, Reports); top search bar with auto-complete and filters.
  - Visual Hierarchy: Use cards for assets (e.g., dataset previews with tags, quality badges); color-coding for governance (green for compliant, red for issues).

- **Key Screens and Flows**:
  - Discovery Dashboard: Unified search results grid with facets (e.g., by catalog type: Unity, Horizon); preview panes showing metadata, lineage graphs, and sample data.
  - Asset Creation Workflow: Stepper interface for deriving datasets (select sources, apply transformations via drag-and-drop); form-based for data products with SLA sliders.
  - Reporting Hub: Embed BI tools in iframes with seamless switching; customizable pages to combine PowerBI reports and Looker dashboards.
  - Governance Overlay: Pop-ups for editing metadata, alerts for quality issues, and collaboration threads.

- **Prototyping and Testing**:
  - Low-Fidelity: Wireframes for core flows (e.g., subscribe to a data product).
  - High-Fidelity: Interactive prototypes with animations (e.g., real-time lineage visualization using graph libraries).
  - Usability Testing: Conduct sessions with 10-15 users per persona; iterate based on feedback (e.g., simplify derived dataset creation if >20% abandonment).
  - Accessibility Features: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high-contrast modes.

- **Deliverables and Timeline**:
  - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Wireframes and style guides (e.g., component library for buttons, cards).
  - Phase 2 (Weeks 7-12): Prototypes and user testing reports.
  - Collaborate with BA for journey alignment and Development for technical constraints (e.g., embedding limits in BI tools).

#### Development Team Specifications
The Development team will define technical blueprints, focusing on modularity, performance, and extensibility. Assume a microservices architecture with API-first design, using languages like Python/Java for backend and React/Vue for frontend.

- **Architecture Overview**:
  - Layers: Frontend (UI), Backend (APIs for integrations), Data Layer (metadata store), Integration Layer (connectors for catalogs/sources/BI).
  - Core Components: Metadata Engine (harvest and sync from catalogs like Polaris); Workflow Orchestrator (for derivations and product creation); Embedding Service (for BI tools).
  - Tech Stack Guidelines: Use GraphQL for flexible queries; Kafka for real-time sync; Docker/Kubernetes for containerization.

- **Integration Specs**:
  - Catalogs: REST/SOAP APIs for Unity/Horizon/Polaris; handle OAuth for authentication; sync metadata every 5-15 minutes.
  - Data Sources: Connectors via JDBC/ODBC; support transformations with SQL-like queries or low-code tools.
  - Data Products: Store in a central repo with versioning (e.g., Git-like); enforce schemas using Avro/Protobuf.
  - BI Tools: Use SDKs for embedding (e.g., Tableau JS API); proxy requests for security.

- **Features Development**:
  - Discovery: Implement Elasticsearch for unified search with ML ranking (e.g., relevance based on usage history).
