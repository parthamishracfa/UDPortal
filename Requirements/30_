### Requirements for Phase 2: Advanced Integrations, Governance, and Scalability of the Single-Pane-of-Glass (SPOG) Portal Using Vibe Coding

#### Overview and Context
Building on Phase 1's MVP—which established core catalog integrations (e.g., Unity, Horizon, Polaris), data source connectivity, basic data product creation, and a unified discovery interface—Phase 2 advances the portal toward a production-ready system. This phase incorporates advanced features like BI tool integrations, comprehensive governance, real-time capabilities, and performance optimizations. We continue leveraging vibe coding tools for rapid development, with an increased focus on AI-assisted refinements (e.g., generating governance workflows or optimization code via iterative prompts).

Phase 2 aims for a beta release within 6-8 weeks post-Phase 1, emphasizing user adoption through enhanced self-service, collaboration, and analytics. Key principles:
- **Vibe Coding Evolution**: Shift to 80-90% AI generation for complex features; incorporate prompt chaining (e.g., generate base code, then optimize for scalability).
- **Success Metrics**: 90% test coverage; vibe coding efficiency improved by 20% (measured by fewer iterations); beta user satisfaction >75% via surveys.
- **Assumptions**: Phase 1 MVP is stable; access to advanced vibe coding features (e.g., integration with LLMs like Grok 4 for code suggestions); pilot user group for testing.
- **Exclusions**: Full production deployment (deferred to Phase 3); custom AI models for recommendations.

This phase aligns with industry benchmarks from 2025 reports (e.g., Gartner on unified data platforms), ensuring the portal supports enterprise-scale operations while maintaining modularity.

#### Scope Definition
- **In-Scope**:
  - Integrate BI and reporting tools (e.g., PowerBI, Tableau).
  - Enhance governance with automated policies, lineage, and quality controls.
  - Add real-time syncing, collaboration, and analytics dashboards.
  - Optimize for scalability and multi-user environments.
  - Expand vibe coding to include automated testing and deployment scripts.
- **Out-of-Scope**:
  - Custom plugin development for niche catalogs.
  - On-premises deployments.
  - Advanced ML features (e.g., predictive analytics on data products).
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 code base; access to BI tool APIs/SDKs; regulatory guidelines for governance (e.g., GDPR templates).
- **Risks and Mitigations**: Integration complexities—mitigate with phased rollouts; vibe coding inaccuracies—enforce dual human-AI reviews; user resistance—include change management in beta testing.
