>> You and I have been working on portals and analytical dashboards (including industry leading tools) for a long time. we now want to explore this idea of building a single-pane-of-glass portal that would allow integrating multiple reports and dashboards from many different tools (such as powerbi, tableau, looker, quicksight and many more) into a single portal. This portal should have these main aspects - 1. integrate with multiple catalog softwares, 2. integrate with multiple data sources and platforms, 3. define and create data products that can be discovered and subscribed to, 4. integrate with multiple reporting and dashboarding software. Users should be able to discover catalog items in catalogs, datasets of data sources, create derived datasets from these data assets, define and create data products, create reports and dashboards from these data sets and data products, and discover and view reports created using any of the tools. Let's not go into implementation now, just thrash out the requirements in a structured yet detailed form. Make sure to include unity catalog, horizon catalog, polaris catalog etc. please revisit the scope and go into as much depth as possible. A deep analysis is needed now.

### Executive Summary

The proposed single-pane-of-glass (SPOG) portal aims to create a unified platform that consolidates data discovery, management, and visualization across disparate tools, catalogs, data sources, and BI/reporting systems. This portal will serve as a centralized hub, enabling users to seamlessly interact with data assets without switching between siloed environments. By integrating multiple catalogs (e.g., Unity Catalog, Horizon Catalog, Polaris Catalog, and others), data sources, and BI tools (e.g., PowerBI, Tableau, Looker, QuickSight), the portal will facilitate end-to-end workflows: from discovering catalog items and datasets, to creating derived datasets and data products, to building and viewing reports/dashboards.

The scope has been revisited to emphasize depth in areas such as metadata management, governance, user adoption, data quality, lineage tracking, and cross-tool interoperability. This deep analysis draws from best practices in unified data catalogs and BI portals, ensuring the requirements address scalability, security, and business alignment. The portal will not only aggregate content but also enhance collaboration, automate compliance, and provide intelligent discovery mechanisms to drive data-driven decision-making.

Key objectives:
- Provide a unified view to reduce data silos and improve efficiency.
- Enable self-service capabilities for data consumers, analysts, and stewards.
- Ensure governance and quality standards are embedded throughout.
- Support extensibility for future integrations.

### Scope and Objectives Revisited

Upon revisiting the initial scope, the portal must extend beyond basic integration to include advanced features like AI-assisted metadata enrichment, anomaly detection in data flows, and customizable user experiences. It should handle complex scenarios such as multi-cloud environments, real-time data synchronization, and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The portal will focus on business value by tying data assets to organizational goals via KPIs and OKRs.

Inclusions:
- Full lifecycle management of data assets: discovery, derivation, productization, reporting, and subscription.
- Support for diverse user roles: data stewards, analysts, business users, and administrators.
- Integration with emerging catalogs like Polaris for Iceberg-based tables to support open formats.

Exclusions (as per instructions): Any implementation details, such as technical architectures, APIs, or coding frameworks.
